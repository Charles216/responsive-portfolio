                        Hello and welcome to my personal portfolio. I am very excited and proud to share with you everything that I have been working on thus far. This is just the beginning of all of the things I look to accomplish as a web developer. Please enjoy as you flip through my projects, I look forward to hearing any and all feedback.
                        <br><br> 
                        A short story about myself -- My name is Charles Grogan, born and raised by way of two very hard working individuals named Thom and Diane Grogan, in the city of Cleveland. I grew up in a very blue collar family. My father sold insurance and my mom started a baby sitting service at the house so I always had someone willing to play with me. I loved creating games and activites to play, solving mysteries, being active, and playing video games. 
                        <br><br> 
                        As I grew older, went off to college - had NO idea what I wanted to do when I graduated and was almost kicked out of school because I hadn't declared a major and I was going into my junior year! I liked to cook so I decided to go the route of Hospitality Management. It was fun, I got to cook, take beer classes, and had a lot of fun with my peers. Looking back, it was a great time, but I would do things a little bit differently. And is the exact reason why I creating this portfolio. 
                        <br><br> 
                        I recently decided that I am going to take control of my life, my career, and my future. I recently decided that I was going to quit my job. I was with the same company for almost 5.5 years. I was working in the auto industry renting cars, then decided to move into car sales. I was selling cars for nearly 2.5 years when I decided that I needed to make a positive change in my life. 
                        <br><br> 
                        I have always loved technology and have always been fascinated by how it works. While I was searching for a new job I was realizing that most of the jobs that I want require technical know how. To which, I had none. I started talking to people in the industry and found out that boot camps are becoming more and more popular, especially reputable ones like this one, through trilogy educational services at Northwestern University. I hope you enjoy my portfolio and I look forward to connecting with you!
